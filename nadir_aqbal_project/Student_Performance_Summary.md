# 📚 Analysis of Student Performance: Summary

## 🎯 Problem Statement
This project aimed to investigate the factors influencing student academic performance, particularly focusing on final grades (G3) in secondary education. The goal is to improve educational outcomes and identify at-risk students for potential targeted interventions.

## 🧪 Methodology

- **Dataset:** Used `student-mat.csv` containing demographic, social, and academic information of Portuguese students.
- **Data Cleaning:** Ensured data quality, handled missing values, and verified data types.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Used descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand the distribution of final grades and relationships with features like school, gender, and parental jobs.
- **Visualization Tools:** Python libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

## 📊 Key Visualizations

- Histogram of final grades (G3).
- Bar charts showing average G3 across categorical variables.

## 🔍 Findings & Insights

- **Grade Distribution:** Slightly left-skewed, indicating higher scores are more common.
- **School Influence:** Students from Gabriel Pereira school scored higher than those from Mousinho da Silveira school.
- **Parental Occupation:** Students with mothers in health-related jobs had lower average G3, possibly due to work-life balance factors.
- **Other Factors:** Sex, address type, family size, and parents' cohabitation status also had some impact, but less significantly.

## ✅ Conclusion

The analysis provided useful insights into the factors affecting academic performance. Key findings include the influence of school and maternal occupation. Future work could involve statistical testing, consider variables like study time and absences, and explore student support interventions.

This project improved data analysis and visualization skills and deepened understanding of educational success factors.
