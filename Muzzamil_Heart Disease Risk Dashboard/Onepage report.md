# Heart Disease Risk Dashboard

## Overview

The Heart Disease Risk Dashboard is a Streamlit application designed to analyze and visualize heart disease risk factors. It provides interactive filters and visualizations to help users understand the distribution and prevalence of heart disease risk factors.

## Problem

Heart disease is a leading cause of death globally, and understanding its risk factors is crucial for prevention. Many existing tools provide basic insights but lack interactivity and customization. This project aims to offer a comprehensive dashboard that allows users to filter data by age, gender, and specific risk factors, providing deeper insights into heart disease prevalence.

## Data Analysis Process

The dashboard utilizes processed data on heart disease risk factors. Users can filter the data using various criteria, and the application provides visualizations such as pie charts, bar charts, and line charts to analyze the data.

A machine learning model is integrated to predict heart disease risk based on user input. The model was trained using a Random Forest classifier, ensuring accurate predictions.

## Features

- **Data Filtering**: Filter data by age group, gender, and specific risk factors.
- **Visualizations**: View pie charts, bar charts, and line charts to analyze heart disease risk.
- **Prediction**: Enter personal details to predict heart disease risk using a machine learning model.

## Key Insights

The dashboard demonstrates that interactive data filtering and visualization can significantly enhance understanding of heart disease risk factors. The integration of machine learning provides personalized risk predictions, offering valuable insights for users.

## Next Steps

Future improvements may include expanding the dataset to include more diverse populations, enhancing the machine learning model with additional features, and integrating real-time data updates for more dynamic analysis.
